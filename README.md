Hello, welcome to my first real odin project.
In this project, i am going to create a HTML recipe page of my favourite dish which is probably gonna be the most delicious food on earth. can you guess it for 100 bucks?
Hint!....it's the most enjoyable Ghanaian local dish and is call Fufu and palm nut soup.

The objective of this project is to get my hands grip on creating HTML files for website and putting all what i've learnt so far into practical action.

This is a fantastic opportunity to demonstrate my skills in building a full website using only HTML.

WISH ME A GOOD LUCK...!
